# Callboard

A webapp for professional theatre companies to manage actor attendance. Replaces physical sign-in sheets with QR code sign-in, admin controls, and offline support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite (in `client/`) + [React Aria](https://react-aria.adobe.com)
- **Backend**: Express API (in `server/`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (schema in `prisma/`)
- **Package Manager**: Yarn (workspaces for client and server)

## Features

- **QR Code Sign-In**: Actors scan a unique QR code per show to sign in (must be logged in)
- **Admin Controls**: Manually sign in actors, or mark as absent, vacation, or personal day
- **Calendar Import**: Import performance calendar from CSV or Excel
- **Attendance Reports**: View and print reports
- **Offline Mode**: Print attendance sheet when offline; enter manual sign-ins when back online (Dexie for IndexedDB)

## Project Structure

- `client/` - React + Vite frontend
- `server/` - Express API
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations

## Data Model (Prisma)

- **Organization**: Multi-tenant; each org has users and shows
- **User**: `admin` or `actor` role; belongs to one organization
- **Show**: Date + Time; has unique sign-in token for QR
- **Attendance**: Links user to show; status can be `signed_in`, `absent`, `vacation`, or `personal_day`

## Development

- Use `yarn` for package management (corepack if needed)
- PostgreSQL required; Docker example in README
- Demo credentials: Admin `admin@demo.theatre` / Actor `alice.anderson@demo.theatre` (password: `password123`)
